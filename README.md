Odin Recipe Project

The Odin Recipe Projcet is the first one I will be taking on, what that means is I will try to display the skills I have learned throughout my journey of learning how to code.

I will attempt to do a deep dive and truly understand how and what I am writing instead of just writing down the code. I hopefully will be able to do this by memory but will write down things I am blurry on and need to read over again.
