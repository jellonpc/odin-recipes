<h4>Taiwanese beef noodle soup is the ultimate comfort food to keep you warm during winter.</h4>

<p>Considered to be Taiwan’s national dish, beef noodle soup is a staple in restaurants, night markets, and food courts throughout the island country. You can easily find two or three adjacent food stalls serving their original variation on the dish with a devoted fanbase. There's even an annual Beef Noodle Festival, where chefs compete for the title of best beef noodle soup in Taiwan.</p>

<p>While the Taiwanese beef noodle soup has distinctly Sichuan influences, such as spicy bean paste (doubanjiang) and Sichuan peppercorns, the exact dish is nowhere to be found in the Chinese province. That’s because the dish originated from Sichuan veterans who fled to Taiwan from mainland China during the 1940s civil war. Taiwanese beef noodle soup was one of the treasures that emerged from the inter-provincial community and culture that evolved out of the military settlements where soldiers and their families lived.</p>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
<li>Make a spice sachet with the star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, Sichuan peppercorns, and white peppercorns.</li>
<li>Add the beef soup bones to a large soup pot. Add enough water to cover the bones and bring the water to a boil. Boil the soup bones for 3 minutes. Drain the bones and wash off any foam and residue from the bones. If using beef shank, boil the beef shank for 3 minutes and drain.</li>
<li>Brown the beef chuck or shank with 1 tablespoon of oil for 15 to 20 minutes in a big soup pot until the meat is caramelized. Set aside the browned beef on a plate.</li>
<li>Turn the heat to medium-low. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the soup pot. Add the garlic, ginger, green onions, onion, and chili.</li>
<li>Fry the aromatics until the garlic is lightly browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the sugar, spicy bean paste, and tomatoes. Fry until the tomatoes are softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the Shaoxing wine. Deglaze the soup pot by scraping the caramelized bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
<li>Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, spice sachet, browned beef cubes, and beef bones to the soup pot.</li>
<li>Turn the heat to high. Add enough water to cover the beef bones.</li>
<li>Once the soup is boiling, turn the heat down to a low simmer. Simmer the soup for 3 hours to stew the meat until tender.</li>
<li>After the soup has simmered for 3 hours, turn off the heat. Remove the beef cubes from the soup and set aside.</li>
<li>Strain the soup through a colander and discard the solids.</li>
<li>Cook your noodles according to the package instructions. Cook the bok choy in the boiling water while the noodles are cooking.</li>
<li>Assemble your beef noodle soup by placing the noodles, bok choy, and beef in a bowl. Ladle the strained soup into the bowl. Garnish with cilantro, pickled mustard greens, and chili oil, if using. Serve and enjoy!</li>
